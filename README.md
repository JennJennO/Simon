Based on the classic memory game.

Press any key to start. The program will select a button and you must click the same button. To advance levels, each new button selected by the program must be added to your sequence. You'll have to remember all previous button clicks before adding another. Have fun and see how far you can go.

Code: HTML, CSS, jQuery
